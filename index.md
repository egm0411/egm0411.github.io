# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Ethan Maun and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is your_major.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    I have taken this class my first semester and found it pretty easy, but I failed because I was dealing with a bucketload of mental struggles that I'm still having to deal with; however, one of the reasons why I liked this lab is because it was easy. Brody took Part 2 while I took Part 1, the BMR calculator, because it was one project that I haven't came across last semester, and I found it very easy to decode. I am a very mathy person and I find that solving math problems are very soothing for me, so when I completed Lab 1, I felt very much satisfied.
    
* Lab 4

    Enoch and I worked on both parts of Lab 4 together. As I have done both of the labs before, I helped Enoch out a ton with the coding, but I didn't take the lead because I thought it would be unfair and a bit dishonest to. But what I loved about working on this lab was being able to bond and discuss solutions with a fellow programmer, as I felt like not only was I solving these problems, but was also building a relationship with a peer.
    
* Lab 8

    This was a lab that I found myself struggling on slightly in class. Again, I'm still dealing with many mental health issues, so my attention in class and attendance record is, layman's terms, utter shit. But because of this I found myself struggling with the how the loop worked. The reason why I picked this lab as an example of one of my favorites is because of how much easier it felt for me to solve than I thought it would be. As soon as I got to coding, it felt like the puzzle pieces clicked into place. I only had to ask the instructor one question and just like that I could finish the whole assignment, and I felt highly accomplished.
